# Words (Normal)  
## Information
Have you ever wanted to flex your vocabulary muscles to your friends? Perhaps you want to learn new words. Well, this is the place for you!
In this fast paced vocabulary game, you put your vocabulary to the test against 2 or more opponents simply by building a longer word than them! 
## Rules  
- Players must write in large, block letters, so opponents can read their words from a distance.
- Players decide on the game language and select a game theme if desired.
- Players must build the longest word they can, beginning with the final letter of the previous winner’s word.
- The winner cannot play the next round. After each round there is a new winner. Instead, the winner polices the following round, awarding silent points, and tracking the score, while displaying the current letter, and lockout letters.
- Points are given only to the winner of each round, equal to the number of letters in the victorious word. Additionally, the scorekeeper (previous winner) awards an additional point (1) to the winner for silence, only to the winner, and only if they are deemed to be silent by said scorekeeper.
- Words cannot be re-used, even if they didn’t win, or were used by a different player.
- If there is a tie, the players in question play a head-to-head round, with a 10 second time limit. They must come up with new words built off the same letter as that which resulted in the tie. Winner receives points from the tie-breaker word, not the original.
- Words must be spelt correctly in order to win. Any player can challenge a would-be victors spelling by showing them a thumbs down. If the accusation is correct, the accuser steals the points and claims that word as their own, with the victory. If the accusation was incorrect, the accuser loses points equal to the value of the accused word.
- Victorious words lock out their final letters. Meaning, if a word ends in y, the next 2 winning words cannot end in y.
- First to 50 wins.
## Examples
After choosing the game language and theme, players will each take a sheet of paper and write their name to determine the start block for the game. Points are not awarded for this round.

Matthew
Clair
Jason
Samantha

In the case above Samantha is the winner, as they have 8 letters in their name. So, Samantha sits out for the first round while the others build a word off “A”, as that is the last letter of Samantha. 

Now that the game has really begun, players write their word in secret, and hold their paper up (word hidden) to announce they’re ready. When all players are ready, the words are revealed.

Matthew: Arbritrarily 

Clair: Analogue 

Jason: Absolutely 

In this case, the winner is “Absolutely”, because “Arbritrarily” is spelt incorrectly, and “Analogue” is shorter. Now that the winner is decided, Jason receives 10 points. At the moment, it is Samantha’s job to award and track the points.

Absolutely 10

Now onto the next round, Samantha, Matthew and Clair have to build a word off the letter “Y”, and it is now Jason job to track and award points.

Matthew: Yesterday 9

Clair: Yelling 7

Samantha: Yodelling 8

In this case, the winner is “Yodelling”, because “yesterday” is disqualified due to the letter y being locked out.
