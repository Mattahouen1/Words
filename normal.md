# Words (Normal)  
## Information
Have you ever wanted to flex your vocabulary muscles to your friends? Perhaps you want to learn new words. Well, this is the place for you!
In this fast paced vocabulary game, you put your vocabulary to the test against 2 or more opponents simply by building a longer word than them! 
## Rules  
- Players must write in large, block letters, so opponents can read their words from a distance.
- Players decide on the game language and select a game theme if desired.
- Players must build the longest word they can, beginning with the final letter of the previous winner’s word.
- The winner cannot play the next round. After each round there is a new winner. Instead, the winner polices the following round, awarding silent points, and tracking the score, while displaying the current letter, and lockout letters.
- Points are given only to the winner of each round, equal to the number of letters in the victorious word. Additionally, the scorekeeper (previous winner) awards an additional point (1) to the winner for silence, only to the winner, and only if they are deemed to be silent by said scorekeeper.
- Words cannot be re-used, even if they didn’t win, or were used by a different player.
- If there is a tie, the players in question play a head-to-head round, with a 10 second time limit. They must come up with new words built off the same letter as that which resulted in the tie. Winner receives points from the tie-breaker word, not the original.
- Words must be spelt correctly in order to win. Any player can challenge a would-be victors spelling by showing them a thumbs down. If the accusation is correct, the accuser steals the points and claims that word as their own, with the victory. If the accusation was incorrect, the accuser loses points equal to the value of the accused word.
- Victorious words lock out their final letters. Meaning, if a word ends in y, the next 2 winning words cannot end in y.
- First to 50 wins.
