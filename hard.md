# Words (Hard)
## Information
Is normal mode too easy for you? Are the standard 50 point games too short? Or perhaps you just want a challenge, well, hard mode is here for you.
This is an evolution on normal mode, so if you don't know how to play, you'd best come to grips with the game in normal mode first.
## Rules
- All rules of normal mode apply. There is only 2 changes.
- When a letter is locked out, it is gone. FOREVER. You will run out of letters eventually.
- In hard mode, the game doesn't end when someone reaches 50 points. Instead, it ends when all players surrender, or when all letters have been used. Then, the winner is decided.
